The algorithm is based on the multi-scale paradigm, and runs in a linear time. Results are similar to those of the best known approaches, while running time is signiﬁcantly faster, enabling dealing with much larger graphs. The paper contains a special multi-scale construction, which may be used for a broad range of ordering problems.},

The problem is to put the n pins into the n holes such that the total wire length is a minimum. We can abstract the pins and wire connections as a graph G with n nodes and numbers associated with the arcs. For an arbitrary G, we establish a lower bound on the total wire length. If G is a rooted tree, an algorithm is presented which requires \$O( \{n{\textbackslash}log n\} )\$ operations.},

In this paper we show that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First we show the completeness of Simple Max Cut (Max Cut with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the Optimal Linear Arrangement problem. We then show that even if the domains of the Node Cover and Directed Hamiltonian Path problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For Graph 3-Colorability, Node Cover, and Undirected Hamiltonian Circuit, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.},

Given distinct labels in \{1,⋯,{\textbar}V{\textbar}\} to the vertices of G, we define the weight of an edge uv∈E as the absolute difference between the labels assigned to u and v. The minimum linear arrangement problem (MinLA) consists in finding a labeling of the vertices of G such that the sum of the weights of its edges is minimized. It is an NP-Hard problem whose corresponding polyhedron has a factorial number of extreme points. We propose a quadratic model for MinLA and use it to obtain a novel compact mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem, featuring O({\textbar}V{\textbar}2) variables and O({\textbar}V{\textbar}2) constraints. We show the correctness of the new model and discuss valid inequalities for the problem. Our findings open new insights on the study of effective exact approaches to the problem. Computational experiments show that the new quadratic and mixed linear models performed better than existing ones in the literature for new and benchmark instances of this problem.},

This NP-hard problem has applications in network scheduling, automatic graph drawing and information retrieval. We propose a heuristic method based on the Scatter Search (SS) methodology for finding approximate solutions to this optimization problem. This metaheuristic explores solution space by evolving a set of reference points. Our SS method is based on a GRASP constructive algorithm, a local search strategy based on insertion moves and voting-based combination methods. We also introduce a new measure to control the diversity in the search process. Empirical results with 252 previously reported instances indicate that the proposed procedure compares favorably to previous metaheuristics for this problem, such as Simulated Annealing and Evolutionary Path Relinking.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the Minimum Linear Arrangement problem from an experimental point of view. Using a testsuite of sparse graphs, we experimentally compare several algorithms to obtain upper and lower bounds for this problem. The algorithms considered include Successive Augmentation heuristics, Local Search heuristics and Spectral Sequencing. The testsuite is based on two random models and "real life" graphs. As a consequence of this study, two main conclusions can be drawn: On one hand, the best approximations are usually obtained using Simulated Annealing, which involves a large amount of computation time. Solutions found with Spectral Sequencing are close to the ones found with Simulated Annealing and can be obtained in significantly less time. On the other hand, we notice that there exists a big gap between the best obtained upper bounds and the best obtained lower bounds. These two facts together show that, in practice, finding lower and upper bounds for the Minimum Linear Arrangement problem is hard.},
