Recently, the number of papers related to Deep Learning is increasing rapidly.
In this paper, we focus on the highly cited arXiv papers from cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) subcategories.
We explore the relationship in authors.
We reorder the relationship matrix into a proximate block diagonal form by minimize the linear arrangement (LA) loss function using a GPU augmented hill climbing algorithm.
We visualize the results as a list that can indicate the relationship in authors.
We hope this analysis can capture some interesting structures of this research community.
