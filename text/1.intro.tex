Deep Learning as a field is exploding.
The number of papers is growing rapidly.

Luckily, arXiv acts as a central hub for important papers and opens to everyone.
This provides a chance for us to analyze those papers procedually.

We harvest the meta data from arXiv service.
And obtain the citation numbers from Semantic Scholar and Google Scholar.
We will see, although the total number of papers is big, the number of highly cited papers is relatively small.

We compare the authorships of the highly cited papers pairwisely to obtain a pairwise relationship matrix.
We reorder the relationship matrix by minimize the minimum linear arrangement (MinLA) cost function, so that the nodes that have relationship are arranged closer.
The optimization is done through a GPU augmented parallel hill climbing algorithm.
We observe that clusters are formed, indicating the structure of the research community.

Finally, we visualize the results as a sorted list of papers, with a corresponding image to indicate the community structure.
We will highlight several famous clusters.
