In this paper, we presented a pipeline to process metadata of highly cited arXiv papers in two subcategories: cs.LG and cs.AI.
Those metadata comes from different sources.
We built a relationship matrix by defining the relationships in authorships.
We reordered the matrix by optimizing the MinLA cost function using a GPU augmented hill climbing method.
The results of the optimization reveal the structure of the research community.
We presented the final results as a web page to help other researchers to understand this social structure better.
