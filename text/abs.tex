The block diagonal form is very useful.
There are many methods in the field of Matrix reordering that can do this even when there is no exact solution.
However, those methods introduce misleading artifacts to the results.
Here, we propose a straightforward but novel loss function that measure the \emph{Weighted Distance to the Diagonal Line} ($L^{WDDL}$) that promotes the block diagonal form.
If we apply a simple hill climbing optimization on $-L^{WDDL}$, we can obtain an approximate block diagonal form.
We visually compare the difference in the resulting matrices between our method and existing methods.
