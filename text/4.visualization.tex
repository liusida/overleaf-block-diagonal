We design a way to visually present the final arranged results.
The goal is to easily navigate through with useful visual clues.
The final visualization is made as a web page.
\footnote{The final visualization can be accessed at: \url{http://star-lab.ai/arxiv/}}

On the left, the vertical line is made of the diagonal line of the relationship matrix.
The larger the clusters are, the more collaberations are there in those groups.

On the right, they are the reordered list of all papers.
One can easily search keywords to locate interesting parts of the list.
