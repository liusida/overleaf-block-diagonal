In this paper, we define relationships between papers by the overlap in authors.
Future work can explore different relationships, e.g. the interactions of the authors' Twitter accounts, or the similarity in the abstract, etc.

The implementation can be further optimized by using sparse matrix presentation instead of a 2D array.
